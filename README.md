# WebGPU Compute Demo

## What is this?
This is a VERY simple example of how to use webgpu compute shaders. I couldn't find an example on the web anywhere so I put this together using the [webgpu API proposal](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/webgpu-api-proposal.html). While I am experienced with CUDA and various shading languages I am not familiar with Metal (hence the simplicity of the program).
